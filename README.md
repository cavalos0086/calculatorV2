Basic calculator to get you started with Angular.js, Jasmine, Karma

#Before:
On my previous post, I created a basic calculator to show you the basic structure of an angular app. I used controllers, ng-models, factories. You can check it out [here](http://cavalos0086.github.io/2015/09/13/angularjs.html).  

In this blog post, I am redoing the calculator example but with new additions:

1. The most important: I am using a TDD approach. I am testing my code using [Jasmine.js](http://jasmine.github.io/2.4/introduction.html), automatizing the test using [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io/0.13/index.html).  

2. I will create a fake server to show you how to use $httpBackend module. You will later understand why I said `fake`. You can read more about $httpBackend [here](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ngMock/service/$httpBackend)
